# Vuejs-Boilerplate-for-Playjs

> A full-featured Webpack setup with CSS loading, file loading, and Vue templates compiling.

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible. 

## Usage

This is a basic starting template to run a Vue.js project. It will load files via WebPack, and build Vue templates. Great for working through examples while learning on the road on your iPad in Play.js

The development server will run on the PORT specified by Play.js. If you change the PORT in index.js Play.js will still use the default PORT when opening the browser.
